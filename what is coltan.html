        Coltan is a combination of two minerals: columbite and tantalite, with tantalite being the most valuable due to its high content of tantalum.<br>
        Tantalum is a rare metal known for its exceptional properties, including high resistance to corrosion, excellent conductivity, and the ability to withstand high temperatures.<br>
        These qualities make it indispensable in the production of electronic components, particularly in the form of capacitors used in devices like smartphones, video cameras, and gaming consoles.<br>
        The use of tantalum in modern electronics helps improve energy efficiency, as it allows for the miniaturization of components and better heat management, leading to significant energy savings.<br>
        The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) holds around 80% of the world's coltan reserves, making it a crucial source for the global electronics industry. However, the extraction of coltan in the region is highly<br>
        controversial due to the connection between mining activities and ongoing conflicts, as well as human rights abuses. Despite this, coltan remains essential for powering next-generation technologies, offering improvements<br> 
        in both performance and energy efficiency across a wide range of high-tech gadgets.<br>
