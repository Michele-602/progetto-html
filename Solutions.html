        <h2><b>Possible Solutions</b></h2>
        <p>The exploitation of labor—especially child labor—in the mining of coltan and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has sparked global concern. In response, several measures and initiatives have been proposed and implemented to address this humanitarian crisis. Below is a summary of the main solutions being developed to combat these issues, followed by final reflections on the progress made and the challenges that still remain.

            <li><b>Government Strategic Plan Against Child Labor (Goal: 2025)</b><br>
            The government of the DRC established a Commission on Child Labor in the mining sector and launched <br> a strategic plan to eliminate the use of minors in artisanal mining by 2025, urging companies to respect<br> human rights throughout their supply chains.</li>
            <li><b>Government Participation in the Cobalt Action Partnership (CAP)</b><br>
                Since 2020, the Ministry of Mines has taken part in CAP, a public-private coalition aimed at regulating <br> artisanal mining, eradicating child labor, promoting legal market access, and formalizing mining <br> operations. </li>
            <li><b>International Collaboration for an Ethical Supply Chain            </b><br>
                The Global Battery Alliance, in collaboration with CAP, works to ensure that the extraction of minerals <br> like coltan and cobalt is conducted in a sustainable and ethical manner, targeting measurable <br> outcomes by 2030 </li>
